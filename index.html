    <h2>History</h2>
    <p><strong>The story of the Taj Mahal began in the early 17th century when the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan fell deeply in love with Mumtaz Mahal, his beloved wife. Mumtaz was not only his companion but also a trusted advisor and confidante. In 1631, she passed away while giving birth to their fourteenth child, leaving Shah Jahan heartbroken. He vowed to honor her memory with a grand monument, one that would symbolize the eternity of their love.</strong></p>
